Testing
-------

To run tests on your machine you'll need to install [Node.js] and run `make install`. Then you can run the following commands:

```sh
make test              # run all the tests
make test-unit         # run the unit tests
```

You can run the unit tests with coverage reporting, which expects 90% coverage or more:

```sh
make test-unit-coverage verify-coverage
```

The code will also need to pass linting on CI, you can run the linter locally with:

```sh
make verify
```

We run the tests and linter on CI, you can view [results on CircleCI][ci]. `make test` and `make lint` must pass before we merge a pull request.


Deployment
----------

New versions of the module are published automatically by CI when a new tag is created matching the pattern `/v.*/`.
